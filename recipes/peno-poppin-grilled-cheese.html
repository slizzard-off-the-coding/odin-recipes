    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tired of the same boring grilled cheese sandwich? Time to crank up the heat - Let's get poppin'!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces softened cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
            <li>1-2 freshly chopped jalapeño peppers</li>
            <li>4 slices bread of choice</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
            <li>8 crushed tortilla chips</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cream cheese, sour cream, and pickled jalapeño in a small bowl. Set aside. Preheat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Slice each roll in half horizontally, then slice the rounded tops off the ciabatta rolls to make a flat top half. Spread 1 teaspoon butter on the doughy cut side of the bottom bun and 1 teaspoon butter on the now flattened top bun. Place 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture, 1/2 of the crushed chips, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese on the non-buttered side of the bottom bun. Place the top half of the bun on the sandwich and place the sandwich on the hot skillet. Repeat with the second sandwich.</li>
            <li>Grill until lightly browned and flip over, about 3 to 5 minutes; continue grilling until cheese is melted and the second side is golden brown.</li>
            <li>*<em>Optional</em> (but highly recommended)* - Remove sandwich and sprinkle cheese evenly onto center of skillet. Place sandwich on top of cheese and grill for 2-3 minutes, or until cheese looks crispy on bread. Repeat for second side.</li>
        </ol>
